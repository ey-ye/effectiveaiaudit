  <h1>Augmentation as Simulation</h1>
  <p><strong>Version 1.0 – Public</strong></p>

  <p>
    Data augmentation has evolved from a model optimization technique into a foundational part of many modern machine learning pipelines. 
    While its benefits are well recognized, this chapter discusses the audit implications of augmentation when it begins to substitute for real-world data collection.
  </p>

  <h2>Understanding Augmentation</h2>
  <p>
    Augmentation refers to the process of creating modified versions of existing data to improve model robustness or generalization. 
    Common techniques include rotation, cropping, noise injection, and synonym replacement. 
    In some domains, generative methods are now used to simulate entirely new examples.
  </p>

  <h2>Why It Matters in Audit</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Augmentation can significantly alter the original data distribution.</li>
    <li>Excessive augmentation may create a misleading impression of dataset scale or diversity.</li>
    <li>Without proper documentation, the boundary between observed and synthetic data becomes unclear.</li>
    <li>Applied post-split, augmentation can unintentionally contaminate test sets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Issues Observed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>High synthetic-to-original ratios are not disclosed in reporting.</li>
    <li>Augmentation pipelines are rarely versioned or reviewed independently.</li>
    <li>Performance metrics are reported without considering augmentation effects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Audit Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Was augmentation used? If so, which methods and to what extent?</li>
    <li>Was it applied before or after the test split?</li>
    <li>Is the model’s performance reproducible without augmentation?</li>
    <li>Are augmentation strategies peer-reviewed and documented?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Policy Recommendations</h2>
  <p>
    When augmentation contributes significantly to training volume, it should be disclosed as a synthetic data process. 
    Organizations are encouraged to version augmentation pipelines and make their effects transparent during audit reviews.
